# Q&A's

"How will we text? You’ll turn our group chats green!"
 A: I can install BlueBubbles. No, you guys don't have to switch to a new app since only iMessages shows the Greeb Bubble. BlueBubbles is a server app for Mac that lets me talk to you through iMessage on Android. Also, Apple has been sued over the Green Bubbles by the U.S. Government and the EU, losing to both. This means that Apple will allow Blue Bubbles directly from an Android device without the need for any external service.

"What about reactions to messages? Will you just get ‘Liked’ texts?"
 A: BlueBubbles fixes that.

"No more FaceTime—how will we video call? Do I have to download another app?"
 A: Google has its own alternatives for calling and video calling. I can use those instead.

"Will you still get my iMessages if you’re on Android?"
 A: BlueBubbles allows me to get iMessages just like iPhone.

"What if you miss family announcements in our shared iMessage thread?"
 A: BlueBubbles lets me see everything, just like iMessages.

"How will we find your phone if you lose it? You won’t be on Find My iPhone!"
 A: Android has "Find my Device" built in.

"What about AirDrop? How will you send us photos quickly?"
 A: Just send it through iMessage, I will receive it on BlueBubbles. If not, LocalSend works as an alternative for AirDrop on any operating system.

"Your Apple Watch won’t work with Android—are you okay losing that?"
 A: Apple Watches have the same features that many other smart watches do. Samsung, Google and Pebble all offer smartwatches that work with Android.

"Will your AirPods even work properly without an iPhone?"
 A: Yes, AirPods work fine if they are given a device to connect to on Bluetooth.

"We share calendars and reminders through iCloud—how will you stay in sync?"
 A: Using a Mac can allow me to view everything, so you may still send me reminders and calendars.

"We pay for Apple Music—will you still use it, or switch to Spotify?"
 A: Apple Music and Apple Music Classical works on Android. Soundcloud, Youtube, Spotify and downloading music all work, if not better.

"What about our shared iCloud storage? Are you just going to abandon it?"
 A: A Mac computer works for this, you can just transfer stuff from iPhone, save it on your computer, then sync it to your Android. If you want to get extra techy, set up a NAS or VPS

"Do they have [specific iOS app] on Android? What if it’s not the same?"
 A: They most likely do, and it is the same.

"How will you access our family photo albums in iCloud?"
 A: The Mac home server will allow you to view everything iCloud.

"Will you still be able to use Apple Pay? What’s the Android version like?"
 A: No. I can just spend the remainder and then use Google pay, Android pay, then I can use my banking app for other stuff, and lastly Crypto apps also let me pay using these.

"Android gets viruses, right? Are you sure it’s safe?"
 A: Apple gets viruses too. Many people aren't interested in checking out exploits and such in Apple, though, and Apple wants to either keep people in the dark (to make more money) or to not freak Apple users out.

"iPhones get updates for years—will your Android phone even stay updated?"
 A: An Android phone can and will stay updated for longer than an iPhone will sustainably and quickly update. Laws in Europe have been passed that a phone must provide updates for at least 5 years after the phone has been released, and similar laws are being looked at in other places like California.

"What if your Android phone gets hacked? Apple is more secure!"
 A: Androids usually get hacked since code is publicly available, meaning attackers can see all the code for the Operating System. Apple's is closed-source, meaning attackers can't see and must use the Scientific Method to find exploits in Apple. Only God and Apple know how secure Apple's OSes really are.

"All your friends have iPhones—won’t you feel left out with green bubbles?"
 A: I won't have Green Bubbles as a problem using BlueBubbles.

"What if your group chats break because you’re on Android?"
 A: I won't have that problem using BlueBubbles.

"People might think you’re the ‘Android person’ now… are you okay with that?"
 A: Usually, pop culture views people with Androids as the people who have Green Bubbles. If you use Mac as a home server for BlueBubbles, you may not even be called "Android person"

"Your iPhone is perfectly fine—why waste money on a new phone?"
 A: iOS/iPadOS slows down iDevices every major update. (iOS 18, iOS 19, etc.) So there's some incentive to buy a new phone. Their operating system is also closed-source and only comes with iDevices, along with adding in the problems of needing to Sideload every week for a non-native iOS app (eg. a Custom Browser, an App you're developing).

"What if you hate Android? Will you just buy another iPhone later?"
 A: Android is pretty easy to like, it leads phone market share at a staggering ~83% total (Samsung, Pixel, Sony, Motorola, etc.)

"Android phones don’t hold their value—how will you resell it?"
 A: There's not much of an incentive to sell an Android phone. Plus, I can always upgrade it if need be.

"How will you back up your stuff without iCloud?"
 A: A Mac will allow you to backup things to iCloud. If not, Google's cloud service, a NAS, an external hard drive and regular backups can let me keep my stuff safe.

"What if you need help? We don’t know anything about Android!"
 A: Google, StackOverflow and Reddit are my best friends. They can fix nearly any problem I have with my Android phone.
 
"Do Android phones even work with our HomeKit smart lights?"
 A: Yes. Eve for HomeKit, Google Home/Alexa, and Home Assistant all are alternatives that allow my Android seamlesss integration.

"Will you still get my Shared Notes and reminders?"
 A: A Mac computer can help with this, although there may not be an Apple-alternative Notes/Reminders for Android users, there is an alternative for the whole family. Goodnotes

"How will we monitor your screen time without Apple’s parental controls?"
 A: You can use Life360.

"What if your Android phone breaks? There’s no Apple Store to fix it."
 A: iPhones break much more easily if you tinker with them. Plus, since everything is public knowledge in the Android world, anything can be fixed by a community of ~83% of phone users.

"Why switch? iPhones just work better!"
 A: Speed, Customizeability, Fun, Tinkering and Androids are basically an effective Mobile Desktop.

"Are you doing this just to be different?"
 A: No, there's so much more I can do on Android than I can on iOS.

"What’s wrong with the way we’ve always done things?"
 A: Nothing. To me, if anything, it's just better to switch to Android for cost of maintenance.

"What if your Android phone doesn’t work with the car’s Bluetooth?"
 A: Android phones use the same Bluetooth technology that your iPhone does. There's no problem here.

"Will you still be able to use Memoji and Animoji?"
 A: Bitmoji, Zmoji and Samsung AR Emoji all are alternatives for Androids. Bitmoji even works on iPhone!

"How do you even transfer everything from iPhone to Android? It sounds complicated!"
 A: iTunes lets me install all my stuff to my PC from my iPhone. Every other app can just be Cloud-Synced or Password-Synced to my Android. There are guides online for almost everything nowadays.
